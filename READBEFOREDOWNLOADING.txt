Put your audio file in <audio> tag to link what music/sound file you want to use and test it your self, the BUTTON will NEVER WORK if you dont LINK YOUR AUDIO FILE. * but i intentionally removed the music because i dont want to get copyrighted law :) *
<<<<<<< HEAD:update.txt

this is the THINGS you have to CHANGE


in HTMLCODE: (bottom section) you will see the comment <!'CHANGE the AUDIO link here FOR IT to WORK music/sounds from button'>

CHANGE: ''YOURMUSIC.MP3'' to your MUSIC/AUDIO File .MP3


<audio src="YOURMUSIC.MP3" id="sound1"></audio>
<audio src="YOURMUSIC.MP3" id="sound2"></audio>


NOTE:
*Changing the id and name of the function depends on you but you also need to update all the js file if you change something so i hope it work for you*
i make some comments to guide you so dont worry


Thanks for reading i hope it work for you and use it!
