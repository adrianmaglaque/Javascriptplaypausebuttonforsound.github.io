Update all <audio> tag link to what music/sound file you want and test it your self but i removed it since i dont want to get copyrighted law :)
this is the things you have to change


HTMLCODE: CHANGE AUDIO SRC FILE AND TEST IT YOURSELF
*Changing the id depends on you but you also need to update the js file*

but on default
button #1 = symbolism(id)
button #2 = shegotmelike(id)

<audio
      src="INPUT MUSIC FILE HERE"
      id="symbolism"
    ></audio>

<audio
      src="INPUT MUSIC FILE HERE2"
      id="shegotmelike"
    ></audio>
